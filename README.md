# Kernel-Flow-applying-in-dynamic-system
## Backgroungs
The kernel flow method is a state of art mechine learning method used in time-series forecasing. It is proposed by Houman Owhadi in 2019 with the paper [Kernel Flows: From learning kernels from data into the abyss](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2019.03.040). 
## Body
A simple kernel flow method used to forecase time-series in a dynamic system is contained in the code. The data set of the dynamic system is a simple ideal mass-spring system which refers to the numecial experiment done by Sam Greydanus et. al in [Hamiltonian Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01563), with the [code](github.com/greydanus/hamiltonian-nn). The program is written by Python 3.8
